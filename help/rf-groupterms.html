There is one node in the graph for each element in the group, and the arrows show how the generators act on the elements of the group. That is, if the group has two generators, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, then there will be one type of arrow (perhaps red-colored arrows) for generator <em>a</em> and another type of arrow (perhaps blue-colored) for generator <em>b</em>. Here is a Cayley diagram of a group; you can see that it fits this description.</p>      <p align="center"><a href="do openGroup S_3|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)"><img src="CayleyDiagram/S_3|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)/0/150/150"></a></p>      <p>The red arrows would connect two elements if multiplying the first by <em>a</em> gives the second; i.e.</p>      <p align="center"><em>x</em> -----red-arrow-----&gt; <em>y</em></p>      <p align="left">just when <em>ax = y</em>. So the arrows represent left-multiplication. (One could also make Cayley diagrams in which the arrows represented right-multiplication.)</p>      <p align="left">Group Explorer has a <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizer</a> for showing you Cayley diagrams. It is documented in full <a href="rf-um-cd-options.html">here</a>, with an introduction <a href="gs-cd-intro.html">here</a>, and a tutorial <a href="tu-cd-manip.html">here</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="cayleytable">Cayley table</a></h3>      <p>See <a href="#multtable">multiplication table</a>. </p>      <h3><a id="classequation">Class equation</a></h3>      <p>The elements of a group can be partitioned into <a href="#conjclasses">conjugacy classes</a>. The class equation is a numerical equation describing this partitioning. For instance, the group <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/S_3.group"><i>S</i><sub>3</sub></a> has three conjugacy classes, of sizes 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The <a href="#order">order</a> of the group is 6, and so the class equation is</p>      <p align="center">1 + 2 + 3 = 6.</p>      <p align="left">All class equations are of this form: The left hand side is a sum of positive integers, each the size of a conjugacy class, and the right side the order of the group. </p>      <h3><a name="closure">Closure of a subset</a></h3>      <p>Not all subsets of a group are <a href="#subgroup">subgroups</a>. The closure of a subset is the smallest subgroup containing that subset. That is, it answers the question, &quot;What must I add to this subset to get a subgroup?&quot; Another way to think of a subset's closure is that it is the subgroup for which the subset is a set of <a href="#generators">generators</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="commutative">Commutative group</a></h3>      <p>See <a href="#abelian">Abelian</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="conjclasses"></a>Conjugacy classes</h3>      <p>The conjugacy class of an element <em>g</em> in a group is the set of all elements <em>hgh</em><sup>-1</sup> for any element <em>h</em> in the group. These are called &quot;classes&quot; because they partition the group (i.e. form an equivalence relation) and are called &quot;conjugacy&quot; classes because the element <em>hgh</em><sup>-1</sup> is called the &quot;conjugate&quot; of <em>g</em> by <em>h</em>.</p>      <p>See also <a href="#classequation">class equation</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="cosets">Cosets</a></h3>      <p>For any subgroup <em>H</em> of a group <em>G</em>, we can speak of the left cosets and the right cosets of <em>H</em>. The notation <em>aH</em> for an element <em>a</em> in <em>G</em> means the set of all products <em>a</em> times an element of <em>H</em>; this set is a left coset of <em>H</em>, because we multiplied by <em>a</em> on the left of <em>H</em>. One could do the same on the right, and form a right coset of <em>H</em>. The collection of all <em>aH</em> for every <em>a</em> in <em>G</em> is the collection of left cosets of <em>H</em>; similarly for right cosets. Cosets of either type partition the elements of the group. </p>      <h3><a name="cyclegraph">Cycle graph</a></h3>      <p>A cycle graph is an illustration of the cycles of a group (<a href="#orbit">orbits of elements</a>) and how those cycles connect. Here is an example cycle graph.</p>      <p align="center"><a href="do openGroup Z_2-_x-_Z_4|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)"><img src="CycleGraph/Z_2-_x-_Z_4|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)/0/150/150"></a></p>      <p>The above graph shows the group <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/Z_2 x Z_4.group"><i><b>Z</b></i><sub>2</sub> x <i><b>Z</b></i><sub>4</sub></a>. One can see that there are two four-cycles (in the bottom half of the picture) which share two nodes (the central node and the bottommost node). In addition to these six elements, there are two other <a href="#orderelt">order</a>-2 elements that are not in either of the two larger four-cycles, shown at the top of the picture. </p>      <p>Group Explorer has a <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizer</a> for showing you Cycle graphs, documented in full <a href="rf-um-cg-options.html">here</a>.</p>      <h3><a id="cyclic">Cyclic group</a></h3>      <p>A cyclic group is one that is <a href="#generators">generated</a> by one element. Therefore it is comprised entirely of the <a href="#orbit">orbit</a> of that element. The Cyclic groups are denoted <i><b>Z</b><sub>n</sub></i> or sometimes <i>C<sub>n</sub></i>, and look just like their name (cycles) when viewed as <a href="#cayleydiagram">Cayley diagrams</a> or <a href="#cyclegraph">cycle graphs</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="gensrels">Definition a group via generators and relations</a></h3>      <p>One can define groups by listing <a href="#generators">generators</a> <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, ... and then writing equations that describe how they relate. For instance, the <a href="#cyclic">cyclic group</a> with five elements can be described as the group generated by <em>a</em> where <i>a</i><sup>5</sup> is the identity element. This is written &lt; <em>a</em> : <i>a</i><sup>5</sup> = <i>e</i> &gt;. The portion to the left of the colon (:) is the lone generator <em>a</em> and the portion to the right is the equation that describes it.</p>      <p>For groups with more than one generator, the situation is slightly more complex, but is essentially the same. The definition &lt; <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> : <i>a</i><sup>4</sup> = <i>e</i>, <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>e</i>, <i>ab</i> = <i>ba</i> &gt; describes a group with an <a href="#orderelt">order</a>-4 generator <em>a</em> and an <a href="#orderelt">order</a>-2 generator <em>b</em> which commute with each other. The last equation <em>ab</em> = <em>ba</em> describes the commutativity of the generators, and therefore implies the commutativity of the whole group. This group is thus <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/Z_2 x Z_4.group"><i><b>Z</b></i><sub>2</sub> x <i><b>Z</b></i><sub>4</sub></a>. But if we had written the same definition with a different final equation, say , we would have come up with a different group (<a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/D_4.group"><i>D</i><sub>4</sub></a>).</p>      <p>One of the columns available for view in <a href="rf-um-mainwindow.html">the main window (the group library)</a> is the definition in this format of every group loaded.</p>      <h3><a name="elementwiseproduct">Elementwise product (of two subsets of a group)</a></h3>      <p>The elementwise product of two subsets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> of a group is written <em>ST</em> and is the set of all products of elements from <em>S</em> with elements from <em>T</em>, in that order. Thus the product is taken on the level of elements, or &quot;elementwise.&quot; In set theory notation, <em>ST</em> = <nobr>{ <em>st</em> : <em>s</em> is from <em>S</em> and <em>t</em> is from <em>T</em> }</nobr>. </p>      <h3><a name="epic">Epimorphism</a></h3>      <p>See <a href="#surjective">surjection</a>. </p>      <h3><a id="IT-1">First Isomorphism Theorem</a></h3>      <p>The First Isomorphism Theorem says that given a <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a> <em>f</em> mapping a group <em>G</em> to a group <em>G'</em>, the <a href="#kernel">kernel</a> of <em>f</em> is a <a href="#normalsubgroup">normal subgroup</a> of <em>G</em>, and when we take the <a href="#quotient">quotient</a> <em>G/Ker(f)</em>, it is <a href="#isomorphism">isomorphic</a> to the image <em>Im(f)</em> as a subgroup of <em>G'</em>.</p>      <p>This is useful in <a href="#ses">short exact sequences</a>, which Group Explorer uses to illustrate the normality of subgroups. (To see an example, open a <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">group info window</a>, click the &quot;tell me more&quot; link next to the Subgroups computation, and search for &quot;short exact sequence&quot; on that page--it will be in the description of any normal subgroup.) </p>      <h3><a name="generators">Generators for a group</a> (or subgroup)</h3>      <p>A collection <em>C</em> of elements of a <a href="#group">group</a> is said to generate the group (and they are called generators) if all possible combinations of multiplications of those elements with one another yields all elements of the group.</p>      <p>For instance, the elements <em>r</em> and <em>f</em> in <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/S_3.group"><i>S</i><sub>3</sub></a> generate the group because the complete list of elements of <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/S_3.group"><i>S</i><sub>3</sub></a> is <em>r</em>, <em>f</em>, <em>rf</em>, <em>fr</em>, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, plus the identity, which can be written as <i>r</i><sup>3</sup>. Thus all elements of <i>S</i><sub>3</sub> are expressible as products of <em>r</em>'s and <em>f</em>'s, so the set <nobr>{ <em>r</em>, <em>f</em> }</nobr> generates <i>S</i><sub>3</sub>. Sometimes this is written &lt; <em>r</em>, <em>f</em> &gt; = <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/S_3.group"><i>S</i><sub>3</sub></a>. </p>      <p>If we consider just the element <em>r</em> in the same group, and ask what set of elements it generates, &lt; <em>r</em> &gt;, we find only the elements <nobr>{ <em>e</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> }</nobr>. Therefore <em>r</em> does not generate all of <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/S_3.group"><i>S</i><sub>3</sub></a>, but only a <a href="#subgroup">subgroup</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="group">Group</a></h3>      <p>A group is a set of elements together with a binary operation (which I'll denote here by *) such that the following criteria hold.</p>      <ul>	 <li>The binary operation is associative: For every <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> in the set, <em>a</em>*(<em>b</em>*<em>c</em>) = (<em>a</em>*<em>b</em>)*<em>c</em>. </li>         <li>There is a special element in the set called the identity, which I will here denote <em>e</em>.</li>         <li>For every element <em>a</em> in the set, there is an element that is its inverse, usually written <i>a</i><sup>-1</sup>, such that <i>aa</i><sup>-1</sup> = <i>e</i>.</li>      </ul>      <p>But this is the dry, boring definition of a group! <a href="gs-visualizing.html">You should be out looking at pictures of them!</a> That's what this program is for!</p>      <h3><a name="homomorphism">Homomorphism</a></h3>      <p>Sometimes called simply a <a href="#morphism">morphism</a>, this is a function from one group to another--that is, from the set of elements of the one group to the set of elements of the other. However, it must not be simply a function, it must also <em>preserve</em> the group operation. That is, it must keep the group's structure intact in the following specific way: For every pair of elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in the domain, the homomorphism <em>f</em> must satisfy the equation <em>f</em>(<em>ab</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>)<em>f</em>(<em>b</em>). &quot;Homomorphism&quot; means &quot;same shape/form&quot; (homo = same, morph = shape/form). </p>      <h3><a name="morphimage">Image (of a subset under a morphism) </a></h3>      <p>If a <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a> <em>f</em> maps group<em> G</em> to group <em>G'</em>, and there is a subset <em>S</em> of <em>G</em>, we can find out what its &quot;image&quot; is under the homomorphism <em>f</em> by simply applying <em>f</em> to each element of <em>S</em>. That is, the image of <em>S</em> under <em>f</em>, sometimes written <em>f</em>[<em>S</em>], is the set <nobr>{ <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) : <em>a</em> is in <em>S</em> }</nobr>. Obviously this will be a subset of <em>G'</em>.</p>      <p>One can also speak of the image of <em>f</em>, meaning the image of the whole group <em>G</em> under <em>f</em>, i.e. all elements of the codomain of <em>f</em>.</p>      <p>See also <a href="#morphpreimage">preimage</a>.</p>      <h3><a name="indexsub">Index of a subgroup</a></h3>      <p>The <a href="#ordersub">order of a subgroup</a> will always divide the <a href="#order">order of the group</a>. So we say that a subgroup's index is the integer resulting from that division. In symbols, if <em>H</em> is a <a href="#subgroup">subgroup</a> of <em>G</em>, then because <em>|H|</em> divides <em>|G|</em>, the index is <em>|G|</em>/<em>|H|</em>, often written [<em>G:H</em>].</p>      <h3><a name="injective">Injective, injection</a></h3>      <p>A function is injective (or <a href="#onetoone">1-1</a>, or an injection) if no two different elements map to the same thing. That is, if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are not equal, then <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) and <em>f</em>(<em>b</em>) are not equal either. An injective <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a> is sometimes called a <a href="#monic">monomorphism</a>. </p>      <h3><a id="isomorphism">Isomorphism, isomorphic </a></h3>      <p>A <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a> that is both <a href="#bijective">bijective</a> is called an isomorphism. In group theory, if there is an isomorphism from one <a href="#group">group</a> to another, that means that those groups are really the same exact structure, but possibly with different names or labels. In other words, they are the same mathematical object.</p>      <p>Oftentimes people do not consider the distinction of labeling significant, and will therefore call two objects the same if they are isomorphic. This is what is meant by the phrase &quot;the same <em>up to isomorphism</em>&quot;; it means the things are the same if we consider isomorphic things to be identical. </p>      <h3><a name="ITs">The isomorphism theorems</a></h3>      <p>The <a href="#IT-1">First Isomorphism Theorem</a> can be illustrated in Group Explorer.	 Other isomorphism theorems do not yet appear illustrated in this software.</p>      <h3><a name="kernel">Kernel (of a homomorphism)</a></h3>      <p>The kernel of a <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a> is the set of elements which the homomorphisms maps to the identity element. Sometimes written <em>Ker</em>(<em>f</em>), this set is the <a href="#morphpreimage">preimage</a> of the set <nobr>{ <em>e</em> }</nobr> (where <em>e</em> is the identity of the group to which the homomorphism maps), in symbols <nobr>{ <em>a</em> : <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) = <em>e</em> }</nobr>. </p>      <h3><a id="subgrouplattice">Lattice of subgroups</a></h3>      <p>I will not define the concept of a lattice here; it is too deep a subject for the small need we have of it. One can find a good definition of it in a discrete mathematics textbook, or an online resource like MathWorld or Wikipedia.</p>      <p>For our purposes, a lattice is a two-dimensional arrangement of sets, with larger objects higher in the arrangement (vertically), and with arrows drawn from smaller objects up to larger ones if the smaller object is a subset of the larger. Because all subgroups of a group are sets, we can arrange them in a lattice. For example, <a href="do%20createSubgroupLattice%20S_3|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)%20MultiplicationTable">click here to see the lattice of subgroups of <i>S</i><sub>3</sub></a> (illustrated using <a href="#multtable">multiplication tables</a>). </p>      <h3><a name="leftcosets">Left cosets</a></h3>      <p>See <a href="#cosets">cosets</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="monic">Monomorphism</a></h3>      <p>See <a href="#injective">injection</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="morphism">Morphism</a></h3>      <p>See <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a>. </p>      <h3><a name="multtable">Multiplication table</a></h3>      <p> A multiplication table for a group is named thus because it is much like elementary school multiplication tables, except that it uses the group elements and operation rather than integers under ordinary, everyday multiplication.</p>      <p>Thus the table is a grid, and across the top row and down the left column every element of the group is listed, and filling the rest of the table is the results of applying the group operation to the elements in the header row and column. For this reason, multiplication tables very well exhibit patterns inherent in the group <em>operation</em>, but elements themselves appear several times in the table, and thus the group as a set is not well depicted. </p>      <p>Group Explorer has a <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizer</a> for showing you multiplication tables. It is documented in full <a href="rf-um-mt-options.html">here</a>, with an introduction <a href="gs-mt-intro.html">here</a>, and a tutorial <a href="tu-mt-manip.html">here</a>.</p>      <p>Group Explorer shows multiplication tables in one of two ways--with or without text in the cells of the table. Consider the following multiplication table for the group <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/D_4.group"><i>D</i><sub>4</sub></a>.</p>      <p align="center"><a href="do%20openGroup%20D_4|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)"><img src="MultiplicationTable/D_4|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)/0/150/150" border="0"></a></p>      <p>This table has no text, and thus the colors of the cells exhibit the abstract pattern inherent in the group operation. Omitting the text from the table allows tables to be shown in small sizes (like in <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">group info pages</a> or <a href="rf-um-mainwindow.html">the group library</a>). If you want to see this same table with the element names in the cells, click on the above table (to open the <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">group info page</a> for <a href="../GroupInfo.html?groupURL=groups/D_4.group"><i>D</i><sub>4</sub></a>) and then click the multiplication table visualizer shown under the Views section. (If you don't want to go through all those steps, just <a href="do%20showVisualizer%20MultiplicationTable%20D_4|Nathan-_Carter-_(ncarter@bentley.edu)">click here</a>.) </p>      <p>Upon inspecting the multiplication table with text included, you can see that for example the element <em>r</em> in the leftmost column, second row, multiplied by the element <em>f</em> (in the topmost row, fifth column) results in the element <em>rf</em>, in the second row, fifth column.  This is because multiplication is done in the order you can infer from this example: element in left column times element in top row.</p>      <h3><a id="normalsubgroup">Normal subgroup</a></h3>      <p>A <a href="#subgroup">subgroup</a> is called normal when any of the following equivalent criteria are met.</p>      <ul>	 <li>A normal subgroup is one whose collection of <a href="#leftcosets">left cosets</a> is the same as its collection of <a href="#rightcosets">right cosets</a>. </li>         <li>A normal subgroup is one which is self-conjugate, that is if <em>N</em> is the subgroup then for any element <em>g</em> in the group, the set <em>gNg</em><sup>-1</sup> = <em>N</em>. Here <em>gNg</em><sup>-1</sup> = <nobr>{ <em>gng</em><sup>-1</sup> : <em>n</em> is from <em>N</em> }</nobr>.</li>         <li>A normal subgroup <em>N</em> in a group <em>G</em> is one for which the <a href="#quotient">quotient</a> <em>G/N</em> is defined.</li>      </ul>      <p>The last of these is probably the easiest to visualize. <a href="#multtable">Multiplication tables</a> and <a href="#cayleydiagram">Cayley diagrams</a> can both organize themselves by the <a href="#cosets">cosets</a> of a subgroup and then separate those cosets (or &quot;chunk&quot; them) to help you visualize the quotient operation. Refer to the documentation on <a href="rf-um-mt-options.html">the multiplication table interface</a> or <a href="rf-um-cd-options.html">the Cayley diagram interface</a> for more information on these features. </p>      <h3><a name="normalizer">Normalizer of a subgroup/subset</a></h3>      <p>The normalizer of a <a href="#subgroup">subgroup</a> <em>H</em> of a group <em>G</em>, sometimes written <em>Norm</em>(<em>H</em>), is the largest subgroup containing <em>H</em> in which <em>H</em> is <a href="#normalsubgroup">normal</a>.</p>      <p>That is, <em>H</em> may not be normal in <em>G</em>, but if we were to remove some of the &quot;problem&quot; elements from <em>G</em>, those that are preventing <em>H</em> from being normal, we would find a subgroup of <em>G</em> in which <em>H</em> is normal. The normalizer is exactly this, the subgroup which remains when you remove as few elements as possible from <em>G</em> to make <em>H</em> normal. </p>      <h3><a name="symmetryobject">Objects of symmetry</a></h3>      <p>Group theory is the study of symmetry in the abstract. But many very concrete objects which one could hold in one's hand have symmetry (or symmetries) to them, and the relationship among those symmetries can be described by a group. Therefore several groups in Group Explorer's library are groups that describe the symmetry of objects that exist in three-dimensional space, and exist in the real world--for example, a cube, a pinwheel, or a pyramid. These objects are called &quot;objects of symmetry&quot; (or objects <em>with</em> symmetry, or symmetry objects).</p>      <p>Group Explorer has a <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizer</a> for showing you objects of symmetry, documented in full <a href="rf-um-os-options.html">here</a>.</p>      <p>A note for users who have upgraded from Group Explorer 1.5.8: Objects of symmetry can no longer be navigated rigidly using group operations as they could in version 1.5.8.

One does not say &quot;4-subgroup&quot; or &quot;20-subgroup&quot; because those numbers are not prime. Also, one can see that if <em>H</em> is a <em>p</em>-subgroup for some prime <em>p</em>, then it is not a <em>q</em>-subgroup for any other prime <em>q</em> unless <em>H</em> = <nobr>{ <em>e</em> }</nobr>. </p>      <p>If you click &quot;tell me more&quot; next to Subgroups in the Computations section of any <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">group info window</a>, you will see that the descriptions of the subgroups tell you which ones are <em>p</em>-subgroups.</p>      <h3><a name="morphpreimage">Preimage (of a subset under a morphism)</a></h3>      <p>If a <a href="#homomorphism">homomorphism</a> <em>f</em> maps group<em> G</em> to group <em>G'</em>, and there is a subset <em>S</em> of <em>G'</em>, we can find out what its &quot;pre-image&quot; is under the homomorphism <em>f</em> by finding all the elements which <em>f</em> maps into <em>S</em>.

The cosets of <em>H</em> (let's use the <a href="#leftcosets">left cosets</a>) are the sets <em>aH</em> for various values of <em>a</em>. To define an operation on this collection, we let <em>aH</em> times <em>bH</em> equal (<em>ab</em>)<em>H</em>. One can prove that this operation is a valid group operation (as per <a href="#group">the definition of a group</a>) if and only if <em>H</em> is a <a href="#normalsubgroup">normal subgroup</a> of <em>G</em>.

Let us call the four morphisms in a short exact sequence <em>id</em>, <em>e</em>, <em>q</em>, and <em>z</em>, from left to right, and the three middle groups in the sequence <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>, also from left to right.</p>      <p>I call the first homomorphism <em>i</em><em>d</em> (for &quot;identity&quot;) because it simply maps the one element in its domain (the identity element) to the identity element in <em>A</em>. As per the definition above, the kernel of <em>e</em> must be the image of <em>id</em>, which is simply the identity element. A nice theorem of group theory tells us that when a morphisms' kernel is the identity, the whole morphism is embedding; thus a copy of <em>A</em> appears in <em>B</em>, that copy being the image of <em>e</em> (for &quot;embedding&quot;). In turn, the kernel of <em>q</em> must be the image of <em>e</em>, which is an <a href="#isomorphism">isomorphic</a> copy of <em>A</em>. This means that the map <em>q</em> effectively zeroes out/removes <em>A</em> from <em>B</em>. The First Isomorphism Theorem then implies that <em>q</em> is a quotient map (hence the <em>q</em>) and that <em>B/A</em> = <em>Im</em>(<em>q</em>). But there's more! Because the image of <em>z</em> is only the identity element, its kernel is all of <em>C</em>. Therefore because this is an exact sequence, the image of <em>q</em> must also be <em>C</em>. This means that the short exact sequence <em>A--&gt;B--&gt;C</em> illustrates the fact that <em>B/A</em> = <em>C</em>.</p>      <p>You can see a short exact sequence illustrated for any <a href="#normalsubgroup">normal subgroup</a> of any group.

Briefly, Galois theory was invented to study which polynomials are solvable using ordinary arithmetic plus square roots (and cube roots, etc.). If you are interested in Galois theory, refer to an abstract algebra textbook, or an online resource such as MathWorld or Wikipedia.</p>      <p>The roots of polynomials have symmetry that can be described by groups, called the Galois group of the polynomials. Evariste Galois (a 19th century mathematician) proved that you could tell by looking at these groups whether the polynomial was solvable. Groups that corresponded to solvable polynomials got the name &quot;solvable groups.&quot;</p>      <p>A group <em>G</em> is solvable if there is a chain of groups <i>H</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>H</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>H</i><sub>3</sub>, ..., <i>H</i><sub>n</sub> such that each group is a <a href="#normalsubgroup">normal subgroup</a> of the next one in the chain, the resulting <a href="#quotient">quotient groups</a> are all abelian, and the chain begins with <a href="#trivial">the trivial group</a> and ends with <em>G</em>.
