<p>This page documents the interface for the large view of an <a href="rf-groupterms.html#symmetryobject">object with symmetry</a>. A symmetry object is one of Group Explorer's four <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizers</a>, all of which can appear either in <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">help windows</a>, <a href="rf-geterms.html#sheet">sheets</a>, or in their own windows. When they appear in their own windows, this is refered to as a &quot;large view,&quot; and you can read about it in general <a href="rf-um-largewindow.html">here</a>. This page concentrates specifically on the differences between a large view for symmetry objects, as compared to the other visualizers. </p>

<h2>Interface specifics</h2>
<h3>Viewing the object</h3>
<p>A symmetry object (unlike multiplication tables and cycle graphs) is a three-dimensional structure. Thus you can click and drag on the view to rotate it in three-dimensional space. This lets you see all sides of the object, and seeing it in motion can give you a better mental picture of it.</p>
<p>Note that because objects of symmetry are three-dimensional, <a href="rf-um-graphicshardware.html">the note on graphics hardware acceleration</a> applies. </p>
<h3>Choosing which object to view</h3>
<p>Some groups have more than one object of symmetry defined for them. For this reason, the topmost portion of the control pane on the right side of a large view for symmetry objecst allows you to choose which of the symmetry objects you wish to view. You choose from a list, as shown in the picture below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/illustration-osoptions.jpg" width="197" height="81"></p>
<p>In this illustration, the triangle is selected, but the user can click on it to open a list. Some groups only have one symmetry object on this list, but others have several. Choosing one changes the view immediately.</p>
<h2>Related interfaces</h2>
<p>The remainder of the controls in the right side of the large window for symmetry objects are described in <a href="rf-um-modelview.html">the help page for three-dimensional controls</a>. </p>
<h2>Changes since Group Explorer 1.5.8</h2>
<p>The most notable change in objects of symmetry since the last version of Group Explorer is that you can no longer manipulate them using what was called &quot;The Navigator.&quot; A replacement for this lost feature is planned for future releases in the Group Explorer 2.0 family. </p>
