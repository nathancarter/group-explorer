After reading these pages, you\u2019re encouraged to either start playing with the software on your own or use the Tutorials to continue the guided tour. What illustrations can you do in group theory? Group theory is a subject that has historically had very few pictures, and when it did (such as wallpaper groups or polyhedra) they served only to exemplify a few select groups, and indirectly. Thus it was possible for a student to have a year or more of abstract algebra without ever picturing the subject in his or her head! This is a loss for any group theory student, and is a particular roadblock to visual learners. Since about 2004, there have been a growing number of resources for learning group theory in a more visual way. Group Explorer is one of them. It provides interactive visualizations for group theory and is designed to be an aid for building intuition and understanding for students as they learn. But it may also offer some new intuitions for those seasoned in algebra as well. A brief overview of its features are given below. Multiplication tables (or Cayley tables) These are a common introduction point for new students into binary operations and groups. Group Explorer allows users to view them, highlight them, compare them, draw homomorphisms between them, take quotients of them, and more. See an example multiplication table here Read more about multiplication tables here CITE(VGT-4.3 MM-1.5 DE-5.3) Cayley diagrams These are a less common but more potent group visualization tool and are the flagship intuition-building device used in Group Explorer.

Many other Group Explorer help pages link here to define terms. Unlike the Group Explorer terminology page , these terms not specific to Group Explorer itself ; all are all commonly used mathematical terms. 1-1 (\u201cone-to-one\u201d) See injective . Abelian group An abelian group is one whose binary operation is commutative. That is, for every two elements a and b in the group, a\\cdot b=b\\cdot a . CITE(VGT-5.2 MM-2.1 TJ-13.1) Bijection, bijective A function that is both injective and surjective is called bijective. Cayley diagrams A Cayley diagram is a graph (that is, a set of vertices and edges among them) that depicts a group. There is one node (vertex) in the graph for each element in the group, and the arrows (edges) show how the generators act on the elements of the group. For instance, if the group has two generators, a and b , then there will be one type of arrow (perhaps red-colored arrows) for generator a and another type of arrow (perhaps blue-colored) for generator b . You can see that the following Cayley diagram fits this description. The red arrows connect two elements if multiplying the first by a gives the second. That is, we have x~{\\color{red}\\longrightarrow}~y just when x\\cdot a=y . So the arrows represent right-multiplication. (One could also make Cayley diagrams in which the arrows represented left-multiplication.) Group Explorer has a visualizer for showing Cayley diagrams. It is documented in full here , with an introduction here , and a tutorial here . CITE(VGT-2.4 MM-1.2 DE-3) Cayley table See multiplication table . Class equation The elements of a group can be partitioned into conjugacy classes . The class equation is a numerical equation describing this partitioning. For instance, the group S_3 has three conjugacy classes, of sizes 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The order of the group is 6, and so the class equation is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. All class equations are of this form: The left hand side is a sum of positive integers, each the size of a conjugacy class, and the right side the order of the group. CITE(VGT-7.5 MM-3.7 TJ-14.2) Closure of a subset Not all subsets of a group are subgroups . The closure of a subset is the smallest subgroup containing that subset. That is, it answers the question, \u201cWhat must I add to this subset to get a subgroup?\u201d Another way to think of a subset\u2019s closure is that it is the subgroup for which the subset is a set of generators . Commutative group See Abelian . Conjugacy classes The conjugacy class of an element g in a group is the set of all elements hgh^{-1} for any element h in the group. These are called \u201cclasses\u201d because they partition the group (that is, they form an equivalence relation) and are called \u201cconjugacy\u201d classes because the element hgh^{-1} is called the \u201cconjugate\u201d of g by h . See also class equation . CITE(VGT-7.5 MM-3.7) Cosets For any subgroup H of a group G , we can speak of the left cosets and the right cosets of H . The notation aH for an element a in G means the set of all products a times an element of H ; this set is a left coset of H , because we multiplied by a on the left of H . One could do the same on the right and form a right coset of H . The collection of all aH for every a in G is the collection of left cosets of H ; similarly for right cosets. Cosets of either type partition the elements of the group. CITE(VGT-6.4 MM-3.2 DE-7.1 TJ-6.1) Cycle graph A cycle graph is an illustration of the cycles of a group ( orbits of elements ) and how those cycles connect. Here is an example cycle graph. The above graph shows the group \\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_4 . One can see that there are two four-cycles (in the top half of the picture) which share two nodes (the central node and the topmost node). In addition to these six elements, there are two other order -2 elements that are not in either of the two larger four-cycles, shown at the bottom of the picture. Group Explorer has a visualizer for showing you Cycle graphs, documented in full here . CITE(VGT-5.1) Cyclic group A cyclic group is one that is generated by one element. Therefore it is comprised entirely of the orbit of that element. The Cyclic groups are denoted \\mathbb{Z}_n or sometimes C_n , and look just like their name (cycles) when viewed as Cayley diagrams or cycle graphs . CITE(VGT-5.1 MM-2.1 DE-6.1 TJ-4) Definition of a group via generators and relations One can define groups by listing generators a,b,c,\\ldots and then writing equations that describe how they relate. For instance, the cyclic group with five elements can be described as the group generated by a where a^5 is the identity element. This is written \\left\\langle a : a^5=e\\right\\rangle. The portion to the left of the colon (:) is the lone generator a and the portion to the right is the equation that describes it. For groups with more than one generator, the situation is slightly more complex, but is essentially the same. The definition \\left\\langle a,b : a^4=e, b^2=e, ab=ba\\right\\rangle describes a group with an order -4 generator a and an order -2 generator b which commute with each other. The last equation ab=ba describes the commutativity of the generators, and therefore implies the commutativity of the whole group. This group is thus \\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_4 . But if we had written the same definition with a different final equation, say bab=a^{-1} , we would have come up with a different group ( D_4 ). One of the columns available for view in the main page (the group library) is the definition in this format of every group loaded. CITE(MM-1.4) Elementwise product (of two subsets of a group) The elementwise product of two subsets S and T of a group is written ST and is the set of all products of elements from S with elements from T , in that order. Thus the product is taken on the level of elements, or \u201celementwise.\u201d In set theory notation, ST=\\left\\{ st : s\\text{ is from }S\\text{ and }t\\text{ is from }T \\right\\}. Epimorphism See surjection . First Isomorphism Theorem The First Isomorphism Theorem says that given a homomorphism f mapping a group G to a group G' , the kernel of f is a normal subgroup of G , and when we take the quotient \\frac{G}{\\text{Ker }f} , it is isomorphic to the image \\text{Im}(f) as a subgroup of G' . This is useful in short exact sequences , which Group Explorer uses to illustrate the normality of subgroups. (To see an example, open a group info page , click the \u201ctell me more\u201d link next to the Subgroups computation, and search for \u201cshort exact sequence\u201d on that page\u2013it will be in the description of any normal subgroup.) CITE(VGT-8.2 MM-4 DE-9 TJ-11.2) Generators for a group (or subgroup) A collection C of elements of a group is said to generate the group (and they are called generators) if all possible combinations of multiplications of those elements with one another yields all elements of the group. For instance, the elements r and f in S_3 generate the group because the complete list of elements of S_3 is r,f,rf,fr,r^2 , plus the identity, which can be written as r^3 . Thus all elements of S_3 are expressible as products of r s and f s, so the set \\{r,f\\} generates S_3 . Sometimes this is written \\left\\langle r,f \\right\\rangle= S_3 . If we consider just the element r in the same group and ask what set of elements it generates, \\langle r\\rangle , we find only the elements \\{e,r,r^2\\} . Therefore r does not generate all of S_3 , but only a subgroup . CITE(VGT-1.4 VGT-2.3) Group A group is a set of elements together with a binary operation (which I\u2019ll denote here by * ) such that the following criteria hold. The binary operation is associative: For every a , b , and c in the set, a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c . There is a special element in the set called the identity, which I will here denote e . The identity obeys this rule: for every a in the group, a*e=e*a=a . For every element a in the set, there is an element that is its inverse, usually written a^{-1} , such that a*a^{-1} = e . But this is the formal definition of a group. You should be looking at pictures of them! That\u2019s what this program is for! CITE(VGT-1 VGT-4 MM-1.1 DE-2 DE-5.2 TJ-3) Homomorphism Sometimes called simply a morphism , this is a function from one group to another\u2013that is, from the set of elements of the one group to the set of elements of the other\u2013that also preserves the group operation. That is, it must keep the group\u2019s structure intact in the following specific way: For every pair of elements a and b in the domain, the homomorphism f must satisfy the equation f(ab) = f(a)f(b) . \u201cHomomorphism\u201d means \u201csame shape/form\u201d (homo = same, morph = shape/form). CITE(VGT-8 MM-4 DE-9 TJ-9 TJ-11) Image (of a subset under a morphism) If a homomorphism f maps group G to group G' , and there is a subset S of G , we can find out what its \u201cimage\u201d is under the homomorphism f by simply applying f to each element of S . That is, the image of S under f , sometimes written f[S] , is the set \\left\\{ f(a) : a\\text{ is in }S \\right\\} . Obviously this will be a subset of G' . One can also speak of the image of f , meaning the image of the whole group G under f , i.e. all elements of the codomain of f . See also preimage . Index of a subgroup The order of a subgroup will always divide the order of the group . So we say that a subgroup\u2019s index is the integer resulting from that division. In symbols, if H is a subgroup of G , then because |H| divides |G| , the index is \\frac{|G|}{|H|} , often written [G:H] . CITE(VGT-6.5 MM-3.2 DE-7.2 TJ-6.2) Injective, injection A function is injective (or 1-1 , or an injection) if no two different elements map to the same output. That is, if a and b are not equal, then f(a) and f(b) are not equal either. An injective homomorphism is sometimes called a monomorphism . Isomorphism, isomorphic A homomorphism that is bijective is called an isomorphism. In group theory, if there is an isomorphism from one group to another, that means that those groups are really the same exact structure, but possibly with different names or labels. In other words, they are the same mathematical object. Oftentimes people do not consider the distinction of labeling significant, and will therefore call two objects the same if they are isomorphic. This is what is meant by the phrase \u201cthe same up to isomorphism \u201d; it means the objects are the same if we consider isomorphic things to be identical. CITE(VGT-8 MM-4 DE-9 TJ-9) The isomorphism theorems The First Isomorphism Theorem can be illustrated in Group Explorer. Other isomorphism theorems do not yet appear illustrated in this software. Kernel (of a homomorphism) The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that the homomorphism maps to the identity element. Sometimes written \\text{Ker}(f) , this set is the preimage of the set \\{ e \\} (where e is the identity of the group to which the homomorphism maps), in symbols \\{ a : f(a) = e \\} . CITE(VGT-8.2 MM-4 DE-9 TJ-11.2) Lattice of subgroups I will not define the concept of a lattice here; it is too broad a subject for the small need we have of it. One can find a good definition of it in a discrete mathematics textbook or online . For our purposes, a lattice is a two-dimensional arrangement of sets, with larger objects higher in the arrangement (vertically), and with arrows drawn from smaller objects up to larger ones if the smaller object is a subset of the larger. Because all subgroups of a group are sets, we can arrange them in a lattice. For example, click here to see the lattice of subgroups of S_3 (illustrated using multiplication tables ). Left cosets See cosets . Monomorphism See injection . Morphism See homomorphism . Multiplication table A multiplication table for a group is so named because it is much like elementary school multiplication tables, except that it uses the group elements and operation rather than integers under ordinary, everyday multiplication. Thus the table is a grid, and across the top row and down the left column every element of the group is listed, and filling the rest of the table are the results of applying the group operation to the elements in the header row and column. For this reason, multiplication tables very well exhibit patterns inherent in the group operation , but elements themselves appear several times in the table, and thus the group as a set is not well depicted. Group Explorer has a visualizer for showing you multiplication tables. More information about it appears in its documentation , introduction , and tutorial . Group Explorer shows multiplication tables in one of two ways\u2013with or without text in the cells of the table. Consider the following multiplication table for the group D_4 . This table has no text and thus the colors of the cells exhibit the abstract pattern inherent in the group operation. Omitting the text allows tables to be shown in small sizes (like in group info pages or the group library ). If you want to see this same table with the element names in the cells, click here to open the group info page for D_4 and then click the multiplication table visualizer shown under the Views section. (Or jump to it directly with this link .) Upon inspecting the multiplication table with text included, you can see that for example the element r in the leftmost column, second row, multiplied by the element f (in the topmost row, fifth column) results in the element rf , in the second row, fifth column. This is because multiplication is done in the order you can infer from this example: element in left column times element in top row. CITE(VGT-4.3 MM-1.5 DE-5.3) Normal subgroup A subgroup is called normal when any one of the following equivalent criteria are met. A normal subgroup is one whose collection of left cosets is the same as its collection of right cosets . A normal subgroup is one which is self-conjugate, that is if N is the subgroup then for any element G in the group, the set gNg^{-1}=N . Here gNg^{-1}=\\{ gng^{-1} : n\\text{ is in }N\\} . A normal subgroup N in a group G is one for which the quotient \\frac{G}{N} is defined. The last of these is probably the easiest to visualize. Multiplication tables and Cayley diagrams can both organize themselves by the cosets of a subgroup and then separate those cosets (or \u201cchunk\u201d them) to help you visualize the quotient operation. Refer to the documentation on the multiplication table interface or the Cayley diagram interface for more information on these features. CITE(VGT-7.3 MM-3.3 DE-7.3 TJ-10) Normalizer of a subgroup/subset The normalizer of a subgroup H of a group G , sometimes written \\text{Norm}(H) , is the largest subgroup containing H in which H is normal . That is, H may not be normal in G , but if we were to remove some of the \u201cproblem\u201d elements from G , those that are preventing H from being normal, we would find a subgroup of G in which H is normal. The normalizer is exactly this, the subgroup which remains when you remove as few elements as possible from G to make H normal. CITE(VGT-7.4 MM-3.6) Objects of symmetry Group theory is the study of symmetry in the abstract. But many very concrete objects which one could hold in one\u2019s hand have symmetry (or symmetries) to them, and the relationship among those symmetries can be described by a group. Therefore several groups in Group Explorer\u2019s library are groups that describe the symmetry of objects that exist in three-dimensional space, and exist in the real world\u2013for example, a cube, a pinwheel, or a pyramid. These objects are called \u201cobjects of symmetry\u201d (or objects with symmetry, or symmetry objects). Group Explorer has a visualizer for showing you objects of symmetry, documented in full here . CITE(VGT-3 MM-1.3 TJ-12.2) One-to-one See injective . Onto See surjective . Orbit of an element in a group The orbit of an element a in a group G is the set of all powers of that element, i.e. \\{ a^n : n\\text{ is any integer} \\} . You can think of this as all the places one can \u201cwalk\u201d using a as a step. In a Cayley diagram , this would be the chain of elements one encounters by following a -arrows repeatedly. CITE(VGT-5.1) Order classes Each element in a group has an order , and thus we can partition the elements of the group into classes which all have the same order. For instance the elements of the group S_3 are listed in the table below, with their orders. Element Order e 1 r 3 r^2 3 f 2 fr 2 rf 2 Thus this group has three order classes: one consisting of the elements of order 1, \\{ e \\} , another consisting of the elements of order 2, \\{ f, fr, rf \\} , and another consisting of the elements of order 3, \\{ r, r^2 \\} . You can learn about the order classes of any group by looking under the Computations section of its group info page . Order of an element in a group The order of an element in a group can be thought of in two equivalent ways. The order of the element a is the smallest positive power of a that yields the identity. That is, if a^k=e and no smaller positive integer exponent satisfies that same equation, then the order of a , written |a| , is k . The order of the element a is the order of the subgroup generated by a , which is also the orbit of a . The order of the identity element is 1 by either of these reckonings. It generates the subgroup \\{ e \\} . Order of a group The order of a group G , written |G| , is simply its size (how many elements are in it). CITE(VGT-5.1) Order of a subgroup The order of a subgroup H , written |H| , is simply its size (how many elements are in it). See also subgroup index . p -subgroup A p -subgroup is a subgroup all of whose elements have an order equal to a power of the prime number p . (See also Sylow p -subgroup .) For instance, if every element of H has order 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,\\ldots (any power of 2), then H is a 2-subgroup. If every element of H has order 1, 5, 25, 125,\\ldots (any power of 5), then H is a 5-subgroup. One does not say \u201c4-subgroup\u201d or \u201c20-subgroup\u201d because those numbers are not prime. Also, one can see that if H is a p -subgroup for some prime p , then it is not a q -subgroup for any other prime q unless H= \\{ e \\} . If you click \u201ctell me more\u201d next to Subgroups in the Computations section of any group info page , you will see that the descriptions of the subgroups tell you which ones are p -subgroups. CITE(VGT-9.3 MM-5.5 TJ-15) Preimage (of a subset under a morphism) If a homomorphism f maps a group G to a group G' and there is a subset S of G' , we can find out what its \u201cpre-image\u201d is under the homomorphism f by finding all the elements which f maps into S . That is, the preimage of S under f , sometimes written f^{-1}[S] , is the set \\left\\{ a : f(a)\\text{ is in }S \\right\\} . Obviously this will be a subset of G . See also image . Proper subgroup A subgroup is proper if it is not the whole group . Technically, by the definition of subgroup , every group is a subgroup of itself. But when we say \u201ca proper subgroup\u201d we mean subgroups that are actually smaller than the group we\u2019re looking inside. Quotient group If H is a subgroup of G , then we can sometimes make a group out of the cosets of H as follows. The cosets of H (let\u2019s use the left cosets ) are the sets aH for various values of a . To define an operation on this collection, we let aH times bH equal (ab)H . One can prove that this operation is a valid group operation (as per the definition of a group ) if and only if H is a normal subgroup of G . In that case, the new group we just formed is called the quotient of G by H , written \\frac{G}{H} . Multiplication tables and Cayley diagrams can both organize themselves by the cosets of a subgroup and then separate those cosets (or \u201cchunk\u201d them) to help you visualize the quotient operation. Refer to the documentation on the multiplication table interface or the Cayley diagram interface for more information on these features. CITE(VGT-7.3 MM-3.5 DE-8.2 TJ-10) Right cosets See cosets . Short exact sequence An exact sequence is a chain of groups connected by homomorphisms such that the image of any one homomorphism in the chain is the kernel of the next homomorphism. A short exact sequence is one with only five groups in it, the first and last of which are both the trivial group . An example is shown below. A short exact sequence is related to the quotient operation on groups. Let us call the four morphisms in a short exact sequence id , e , q , and z , from left to right, and the three middle groups in the sequence A , B , and C , also from left to right. I call the first homomorphism id (for \u201cidentity\u201d) because it simply maps the one element in its domain (the identity element) to the identity element in A . As per the definition above, the kernel of e must be the image of id , which is simply the identity element. A nice theorem of group theory tells us that when a morphisms\u2019 kernel is the identity, the whole morphism is injective ; thus a copy of A appears in B , that copy being the image of e (which stands for \u201cembedding,\u201d a synonym for injection ). In turn, the kernel of q must be the image of e , which is an isomorphic copy of A . This means that the map q effectively zeroes out or removes A from B . The First Isomorphism Theorem then implies that q is a quotient map (hence the name) and that \\frac{B}{A} = \\text{Im}(q) . But there\u2019s more! Because the image of z is only the identity element, its kernel is all of C . Therefore because this is an exact sequence, the image of q must also be C . This means that the short exact sequence A\\to B\\to C illustrates the fact that \\frac{B}{A}=C . You can see a short exact sequence illustrated for any normal subgroup of any group. Go to a group\u2019s info page , to the Subgroups section under Computations, and click \u201ctell me more.\u201d Any normal subgroup will provide a link to a sheet illustrating the quotient via a short exact sequence. Simple group A simple group is a non- trivial group with no non- trivial , proper , normal subgroups . Among abelian groups, the only simple groups are the cyclic groups of prime order. The smallest non- abelian simple group is A_5 . CITE(MM-5.7 TJ-10.2) Solvable group, solvable decomposition Solvable groups are important in Galois theory, which is too large a topic to embark on here. Briefly, Galois theory was invented to study which polynomials are solvable using ordinary arithmetic plus radicals. If you are interested in Galois theory, refer to an abstract algebra textbook or an online resource . The roots of polynomials have symmetry that can be described by groups, called the Galois group of the polynomials. Evariste Galois (a 19th century mathematician) proved that you could tell by looking at these groups whether the polynomial was solvable. Groups that corresponded to solvable polynomials got the name \u201csolvable groups.\u201d A group G is solvable if there is a chain of groups H_1, H_2, H_3, \\ldots, H_n such that each group is a normal subgroup of the next one in the chain, the resulting quotient groups are all abelian, and the chain begins with the trivial group and ends with G . You can see a diagram illustrating this for any solvable group by looking under the Computations section of the group\u2019s info page . CITE(VGT-10 MM-6 TJ-13.2) Subgroup If S is a subset of the group G (i.e. a subset of the set of elements of G ) then we say S is a subgroup if it is also a group under the operation of G . A subset S of a group G may fail to be a subgroup in a few different ways; here are examples. If S does not contain the identity element, it violates one of the criteria in the definition of a group . If S contains an element but not that element\u2019s inverse, it would violates another of those criteria. If S contains two elements but not their product, then the binary operation of G cannot be said to be a binary operation on S , because it maps some pairs from S outside of S . CITE(VGT-6 MM-3.1 DE-4.1 TJ-3.3) Surjective, surjection A function is surjective (or onto , or a surjection) from a set A to a set B if every element of B is mapped to by some element of A . That is, if b is in B , then there must be some a in A such that f(a) = b . A surjective homomorphism is sometimes called an epimorphism . Sylow p-subgroup A Sylow p -subgroup is a maximal p -subgroup; that is, no subgroup properly containing this one is still a p -subgroup. If you click \u201ctell me more\u201d next to Subgroups in the Computations section of any group info page , you will see that the descriptions of the subgroups tell you which ones are Sylow p -subgroups. CITE(VGT-9 MM-5.6 TJ-15) Symmetry objects See objects of symmetry . Trivial group/subgroup The trivial group is the group with only one element. You can see its information here.

A short exact sequence is one with only five groups in it, the first and last of which are both the trivial group . An example is shown below. A short exact sequence is related to the quotient operation on groups. Let us call the four morphisms in a short exact sequence id , e , q , and z , from left to right, and the three middle groups in the sequence A , B , and C , also from left to right. I call the first homomorphism id (for \u201cidentity\u201d) because it simply maps the one element in its domain (the identity element) to the identity element in A . As per the definition above, the kernel of e must be the image of id , which is simply the identity element. A nice theorem of group theory tells us that when a morphisms\u2019 kernel is the identity, the whole morphism is injective ; thus a copy of A appears in B , that copy being the image of e (which stands for \u201cembedding,\u201d a synonym for injection ). In turn, the kernel of q must be the image of e , which is an isomorphic copy of A . This means that the map q effectively zeroes out or removes A from B .

A Cayley diagram is one of Group Explorer\u2019s four visualizers , all of which can appear either in group info pages , sheets , or in their own pages. When they appear in their own pages, this is refered to as a \u201clarge view,\u201d and you can read about it in general here . This page covers the specifics for large views of Cayley diagrams. Choosing which diagram to view There are two types of Cayley diagrams available in Group Explorer, the kind you instruct Group Explorer to construct for you and the kind that was designed in advance by the author of the group file . Most group files do not come with diagrams defined by the author, but Group Explorer can construct Cayley diagrams for any group in its library, so no group will be without a diagram. The top of the Diagram tab (the third of the three tabs in the right hand pane) allows you to choose a diagram from a drop-down list. The items in the list are one of two types. The first item in the list reads \u201cGenerate diagram\u201d and instructs Group Explorer to generate a Cayley diagram according to the instructions you provide in the other controls on the diagram page, specifically the generation table . The other items on the list instruct Group Explorer to load a diagram defined by the group author. In doing so, you will disable the controls for generating and chunking in the diagram. Viewing the diagram A Cayley diagram (unlike multiplication tables and cycle graphs) is a three-dimensional structure. Thus you can left-click and drag [one-finger drag] on the view to rotate it in three-dimensional space; you can right-click and drag [two-finger drag] to translate it; and you can use the mouse wheel [pinch open/close] to zoom in and out. This lets you see all sides of the diagram, and seeing it in motion can give you a better mental picture of it. Changing the positions of nodes in the diagram You can customize the appearance of any Cayley diagram by dragging the nodes in it around in three dimensions to any position you like. To drag the nodes around, hold the shift key while you click on the node and drag. [On a touch device just start a one-finger drag on the node.] It will move in the plane parallel to the screen. As you move the node you may find that it obscures some of the arcs; you can change the curvature of the arcs and arrows in the diagram to avoid this. To reset the diagram to its original configuration, simply reload the page in your browser. Note that because chunking depends on the positions of nodes in the diagram, if you reposition the nodes in this way you may have to redisplay the chunking. Simply reselect the desired subgroup from the \u201cChunk this subgroup\u201d drop-down list at the bottom of the Diagram tab to do so. Changing the arcing of arrows in the diagram You can customize the degree to which the arcs and arrows in the diagram are curved. Usually an arc in the diagram takes a straight path from its source node to its destination node. The exceptions to this are when the diagram is inherently round, and so the arrows follow the curvature of the diagram, or when there are nodes in the way and a curved path would avoid them. However you can feel free to improve on Group Explorer \u2018s decisions in this matter by clicking in the middle of an arc in the diagram while holding down the shift key, and dragging to increase or decrease the amount of arcing it has. [On a touch device just start a one-finger drag on the arc. The arc color will change when it is selected.] You will not be able to change the direction of the arcing, only its amount. The Diagram tab Note that the controls panel for Cayley diagram large views has three tabs at the top: Subsets, View, and Diagram. The Subsets tab allows you to compute and highlight subsets of the group, and the View tab allows you to change some cosmetic options of the diagram; see below for information on each of these tabs . The Diagram tab allows you to choose a predefined diagram to view or specify parameters for how Group Explorer should construct a diagram for you. This section describes the controls on the Diagram tab. Organizing by a subgroup The most common way a user reorganizes a diagram is to focus on a particular subgroup. Group Explorer therefore has a shortcut for this purpose, to alleviate wading through the technical options documented below. Clicking [tapping] anywhere in the generator table brings up a menu whose last item is \u201cOrganize by.\u201d Choosing that option lists all the subgroups by which one can organize the Cayley diagram. Selecting one reorganizes the entire generator table (and therefore the diagram) to bring together the elements in the subgroup and in each of its cosets. Further tweaking of the axes assigned to each generator may be necessary to get the diagram to look exactly the way you like, but this shortcut can save a lot of time. It is particularly useful in examining whether a subgroup is normal . When the diagram is organized by the subgroup and its cosets, is it clear that the arrows for generators that connect one coset to another agree on where each coset should be mapped? Generators, and assigning them priority, axes, and an order Group Explorer takes three factors into account when generating a diagram\u2013a list of generators for the group, an axis for each generator, and an order for nesting those axes. Each of these options is specified in the table titled \u201cGenerate diagram this way:\u201d in the image above. Let us consider each of these options here. A list of generators for the group The leftmost column in the table lists generators for the group. The order is significant when the group is nonabelian. You can select new generators by clicking [tapping] on a generator and selecting a new one from the list. When you are choosing generator n , only the elements not in the subgroup generated by generators 1 through n-1 are available as options. You can reorder the generators in the table by clicking a row header (numbered 1, 2, \u2026) and dragging [one-finger dragging] it up or down. The first step Group Explorer peforms (invisibly) when generating a Cayley diagram is to arrange the elements of the group into a grid without assigning them positions in space. Generators that are higher in the table are used to generate local regions of that grid, and those that are lower in the table are used to expand local regions to the global diagram. For instance, here is a comparison of two different choices of generators for the group S_3 . (Note that rf = fr^2 and fr = r^2f , and we assume right multiplication in both cases.) Using generators r and f (in that order) creates an internal table that looks like the following. \\begin{array}{ccc} e & r & r^2 \\\\ f & fr & fr^2 \\end{array} It generates diagrams like those shown below, depending on the choice of axes. Using generators f and r (in that order) creates an internal table that looks like \\begin{array}{cc} e & f \\\\ r & rf \\\\ r^2 & r^2f \\end{array} It generates diagrams like those shown below, depending on the choice of axes. The following section explains the choice of axes. An axis for each generator The second column in the generation table shows axes graphically, one for each generator. These determine how the tables of elements discussed above will be laid out in space. In each pair of diagrams above, the diagram on the left was generated by assigning: the generator r to the axis \u201clinear in y ,\u201d depicted by the following icon, and the generator f to the axis \u201clinear in x ,\u201d depicted by the following icon. You can see how the r arrows move vertically and the f arrows move horizontally, respecting this setting. But the diagram on the right of each pair was generated by assigning: the generator r to the axis \u201crotated in x,y ,\u201d depicted by the following icon, and the generator f to the axis \u201clinear in y ,\u201d depicted by the following icon. You can see how the f generators are vertical at the top of the diagram, near the identity element, thus obeying the assignment to the \u201clinear in y \u201d axis. An order for nesting the axes Even having chosen all of the above options does not completely determine how the diagram should be laid out in space. For instance, in the round diagrams above the user chose one linear axis and one rotational axis. How did Group Explorer know to make it a ring of lines as opposed to a line of rings? The answer is that the f generator was marked \u201cinside\u201d and the r generator was marked \u201coutside\u201d in the order column. Choosing different options yields different diagrams, as shown below. A ring of lines A line of rings Note: If the order is changed from the default (which has the innermost generator on top, down to the outermost on bottom) then chunking will be disabled. The reason for this is that with some more complex groups, if the order of generation does not match the order of nesting of the axes, chunks could take on complex shapes that would need to twist to avoid one another. See Chunking , below. Arrows You can put into a Cayley diagram a set of arrows representing any element in the group except the identity. Each new set of arrows will be a different color. You can include as many or as few sets as you like, and Group Explorer automatically colors them with hues as far apart in the spectrum as it can (given how many different types of arrows you require). Custom Cayley diagrams come with their own lists of default arrow sets, but you can still add or remove them after you have displayed the custom diagram. Auto-generated diagrams, by default, use one type of arrow for each generator in the table at the top of the Diagram tab; again, add and remove as you like. You can also choose whether arrows indicate right multiplication by a generator or left multiplication. By default, Group Explorer assumes right multiplication and the predefined Cayley diagrams shipped with Group Explorer use right multiplication. They may look bad if you change the arrows to mean left multiplication. You can also control the placement of arrowheads from the View tab; see below . Chunking When trying to visualize the cosets of a subgroup, it can be useful to have them grouped visually. This option is available in both multiplication tables and Cayley diagrams, two situations in which such an organization is possible. Chunking cosets in a Cayley diagram means wrapping them in semi-transparent boxes which group the nodes of the cosets. For example, consider the grouping of two-element cosets of the subgroup \\{ e, f \\} in S_3 shown below. To choose which subgroup\u2019s cosets should be chunked, simply choose the subgroup from the drop-down list at the bottom of the Diagram tab. Note that which subgroups are available is determined by the structure of the diagram, which is determined by the order of generators. If the generators are a,b,c,d (in that order) then the only cosets available for chunking will be \\langle d \\rangle , \\langle c,d \\rangle , \\langle b,c,d \\rangle , and the whole group \\langle a,b,c,d \\rangle . Note also that chunking is disabled when the order of generation of the diagram does not match the order of nesting of the axes; see more information above . CITE(VGT-8.2 MM-4 DE-9) Related interfaces The controls in the Subsets tab on the right side of the large window for Cayley diagrams are described in the help page for subset controls . The controls in the View tab on the right side of the large window for Cayley diagrams are described in the help page for three-dimensional controls , with the exception of two controls specific to Cayley diagrams, shown below. Use the checkbox next to the phrase \u201cShow labels of this size:\u201d to turn on or off the text next to each node in the diagram, which labels the node with the name of the element that it represents. The slider beneath the phrase \u201cShow labels of this size:\u201d decides the size of the font used in the labels. Moving the slider to the left gives small fonts, and to the right large fonts. You can control the placement of arrowheads along arcs in the diagram by dragging the \u201cArrowhead placement\u201d slider. When it is at its right extent, arrowheads are abutted against the destination node of the arc; when it is at its left extent, they are near the source node.","title":"Cayley Diagram Options"},{"location":"rf-um-cd-options/#choosing-which-diagram-to-view","text":"There are two types of Cayley diagrams available in Group Explorer, the kind you instruct Group Explorer to construct for you and the kind that was designed in advance by the author of the group file .

For instance, in the round diagrams above the user chose one linear axis and one rotational axis. How did Group Explorer know to make it a ring of lines as opposed to a line of rings? The answer is that the f generator was marked \u201cinside\u201d and the r generator was marked \u201coutside\u201d in the order column. Choosing different options yields different diagrams, as shown below. A ring of lines A line of rings Note: If the order is changed from the default (which has the innermost generator on top, down to the outermost on bottom) then chunking will be disabled. The reason for this is that with some more complex groups, if the order of generation does not match the order of nesting of the axes, chunks could take on complex shapes that would need to twist to avoid one another. See Chunking , below.","title":"An order for nesting the axes"},{"location":"rf-um-cd-options/#arrows","text":"You can put into a Cayley diagram a set of arrows representing any element in the group except the identity. Each new set of arrows will be a different color. You can include as many or as few sets as you like, and Group Explorer automatically colors them with hues as far apart in the spectrum as it can (given how many different types of arrows you require). Custom Cayley diagrams come with their own lists of default arrow sets, but you can still add or remove them after you have displayed the custom diagram. Auto-generated diagrams, by default, use one type of arrow for each generator in the table at the top of the Diagram tab; again, add and remove as you like. You can also choose whether arrows indicate right multiplication by a generator or left multiplication. By default, Group Explorer assumes right multiplication and the predefined Cayley diagrams shipped with Group Explorer use right multiplication. They may look bad if you change the arrows to mean left multiplication. You can also control the placement of arrowheads from the View tab; see below .","title":"Arrows"},{"location":"rf-um-cd-options/#chunking","text":"When trying to visualize the cosets of a subgroup, it can be useful to have them grouped visually. This option is available in both multiplication tables and Cayley diagrams, two situations in which such an organization is possible. Chunking cosets in a Cayley diagram means wrapping them in semi-transparent boxes which group the nodes of the cosets. For example, consider the grouping of two-element cosets of the subgroup \\{ e, f \\} in S_3 shown below. To choose which subgroup\u2019s cosets should be chunked, simply choose the subgroup from the drop-down list at the bottom of the Diagram tab. Note that which subgroups are available is determined by the structure of the diagram, which is determined by the order of generators. If the generators are a,b,c,d (in that order) then the only cosets available for chunking will be \\langle d \\rangle , \\langle c,d \\rangle , \\langle b,c,d \\rangle , and the whole group \\langle a,b,c,d \\rangle .

It consists of several sections, each with a heading and a body. On first visiting the page most of the bodies are hidden, as indicated by a \u2018\u25b6\u2019 sign to the left of the heading. Clicking the \u2018\u25b6\u2019 sign expands the body, and changes the \u2018\u25b6\u2019 sign to a \u2018\u25bc\u2019. Clicking the \u2018\u25bc\u2019 sign hides the body again. You can also hide/expose all the section together by clicking on the \u2018v\u2019 and \u2018^\u2019 icons in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Let us consider each section that appears in a Group Info page separately. It may help you to open an example group info page now and read it alongside this help page. Facts The section presents basic facts about a group such as its definition , order , and any other names it has besides its primary name (which is the title of each Group Info page). Some (but not all) groups contain notes with a description of the group, which appears in this section. Views Group Explorer is all about visualization, and thus the Views section receives high priority. To the right of the heading a row of small thumbnails shows a sample of the various ways to visualize the group. Expanding this section by clicking the \u2018\u25b6\u2019 sign to the left of the heading exposes larger previews of every way to visualize the group, including all the Cayley diagrams , a multiplication table , a cycle graph , and any objects of symmetry the group has. Computed properties Group Explorer computes information about each group it loads. For example, it computes all of its subgroups, which ones are normal, information about conjugacy classes, and more. A summary of this information is shown to the right of each subheading in this section, but much more information is available than it may seem from the summaries. Users are encouraged to expand the bodies by clicking on the \u2018\u25b6\u2019 sign to the left of each subheading to find out reasons for the computations, and often many additional helpful illustrations and computations. Generators Groups can be generated in many ways and some groups come with a few different commonly-used sets of generators chosen. If the group has no pre-selected set of generators built in, Group Explorer computes one such (minimum-size) set when the group is loaded. Each list of generators is given in this section. CITE(VGT-1.4 VGT-2.3) Naming schemes The structure of a group is independent of whatever symbols we use to represent the elements of the group. For this reason, a group may come with several different lists of names for its elements, and the user may choose any one of them to be used as the primary way of representing the elements of the group. This section lets the user make such a selection and also create new naming schemes. This section also lets users remove or edit any of their previously-defined naming schemes; this information is stored in the user\u2019s web browser so that it will be preserved even when they leave the site. The section contains a link that reads \u201cClick here to add a new representation for this group\u201d and possibly also links that read \u201cClick here to edit this representation.\u201d (Note that \u201c naming scheme \u201d and \u201c representation \u201d are interchangeable terms.) In both cases, if you click the link, an interface like the following one appears, allowing you to custom-define a naming scheme for the elements of the group. The left column lists the default element names, the center column shows the current naming as it will be rendered elsewhere, and the right column contains a text area in which you can enter your own representation. The text area will display your entry as plain text, but elsewhere it will be displayed as HTML, so if you would like the permutation (0 1 2) to be shown as r -1 in a Cayley diagram, enter \u201c<i>r</i><sup>-1</sup>\u201d into the text area, as shown in the illustration above. You can preview the HTML by clicking \u201c Display changes as they would appear, without saving them.\u201d, and they will appear formatted in HTML in the center column. When you are done, if you choose \u201c Save changes and close editor.\u201d, your changes will be committed and you will have defined a new representation (or changed an old representation) of the elements of the group. A few notes about entering HTML in the text area: You may use any Unicode character you like, as well as HTML entities like &Zopf; or &#8484;. HTML can be more verbose than plain text, so on platforms that support it you can extend the text area by dragging the right-hand edge (as shown above in the representation for (0 1)). Names can be blank, and they don\u2019t have to be unique. (In practice, this just means you can save partially completed work that has blanks or duplications that you intend to correct later.) While Group Explorer can generally makes sense of the HTML you enter, some results may be unexpected. You can style the HTML using a construct like <i style=\u201dcolor: red\u201d>r</i>, but the style may not work in all the visualizers. And multi-line names (those containg <br> or <hr> elements, for example), don\u2019t always display as desired. Try it out to make sure! Links in the group info window to edit representations are present only for representations that the user has created. Naming schemes built into the group in Group Explorer are uneditable by the end user. Notes Users can add their own personal notes to a group to supplement the default information in any way they see fit. Such information appears in this section, with controls for editing it.

Display of a homomorphism The top of the homomorphism edit window allows you to customize the appearance of the homomorphism as an object in a sheet . Morphism name: This is filled with some default text, which will be shown in a small rectangular label on the morphism arrow in the sheet, as shown below. The morphism name is displayed as HTML, so, as described here , if you would like the morphism name to appear as \u201cf 2 \u201c, you may enter \u201cf<sub>2</sub>\u201d, and the following will be displayed: Show domain and codomain If the checkbox beneath it, \u201cShow domain and codomain,\u201d is checked, then the label will be slightly larger, including the specified information, as shown below. Show defining pairs This box is not checked by default, but when checked, it augments the label with a list of all generating pairs, as in the \u201cMapping\u201d portion of the dialog, discussed below . See the example below. Show injective/surjective This box is not checked by default, but when checked, it augments the label as follows: If the homomorphism is injective , then the phrase \u201c1-1\u201d is added (because \u201cone-to-one\u201d is a shorthand for \u201cinjective\u201d). Otherwise, the phrase \u201cnot 1-1\u201d is added. If the homomorphism is surjective , then the phrase \u201conto\u201d is added (because \u201conto\u201d is a shorthand for \u201csurjective\u201d). Otherwise, the phrase \u201cnot onto\u201d is added. Two of these phrases appear in the example shown below. Draw multiple arrows This box is not checked by default, but when checked, it replaces the single arrow of the morphism with several arrows, one for each element of the domain. The source of these arrows is dependent on the visualizer; for instance, in the multiplication table below, the left column of the multiplication table is used. The endpoint of the arrows is determined by the map; in the example below, the map z is the zero map, mapping all elements to the identity. Arrows margin The arrows margin adjustment determines how far from the center of the visualizers\u2019 representations of the source and target group elements the arrows should begin and end. This can keep the arrowheads from obscuring the target element name in a complicated group. The units represent the percentage of the distance between the two elements to move the arrowheads away from the target. The number and the slider are synchronized, as described here . Mathematical definition of the homomorphism The bottom half of the homomorphism edit window allows you to specify the homomorphism as a function, a map from one group to another. CITE(VGT-8 MM-4 DE-9 TJ-9 TJ-11) Pairs in the map Under the heading \u201cDefine the homomorphism here,\u201d we have a table listing which elements of the homomorphism\u2019s domain map to which elements of its codomain. Each row of the table is a pair of elements, call them d from the domain and c from the codomain, that have been added to the homomorphism already, meaning that the user has stipulated that f(d)=c (if the morphism is named f ). Next to each pair in the map appears a \u201cRemove\u201d button so that if you wish to edit the morphism by mapping d to a different element, you can remove the pair (d,c) from the map and then assign d a new image, as documented below. The user assigns a pairing (d,c) by selecting d from the domain drop-down list beneath the table and c from the codomain list, then clicking the \u201cAdd:\u201d button. Because of the way the drop-down lists are arranged, they will read like the equation f(d)=c before you click \u201cAdd,\u201d to ensure that you\u2019re adding the pair you intend. The domain drop-down list contains only elements whose image has not already been determined by the pairs that have been added to the map. For instance, if you have already placed (a_1,b_1) and (a_2,b_2) into the map, then by the properties of homomorphisms, the image of all elements of the subgroup \\langle a_1,a_2 \\rangle have been determined. Thus none of those elements will show up in the domain drop-down list, because none are assignable any longer. When the domain elements of the pairs in the map don\u2019t generate the entire domain, Group Explorer searches for any homomorphism extending the pairs in the table and uses that. The display window is continuously updated with the current mapping, including Group Explorer\u2019s choices for unmapped elements, so the arrows shown always represent the current definition. (You may need to select \u201cDraw multiple arrows\u201d to see the full details.) You can also click on \u201cFull morphism mapping\u201d to see a synchronized display of the entire homomorphism in tabular form. Then you can simply continue to add pairs to the map to specify exactly the one you want. The codomain drop-down list contains only elements that could legitimately be the image of the element chosen in the domain drop-down list. By \u201ccould legitimately be the image,\u201d I mean that there exists some homomorphism that contains the pairs already added to the map plus the new pair you might add. Thus this constraint ensures that you can use the editor to define only homomorphisms, not any other kind of function between groups.

A multiplication table is one of Group Explorer\u2019s four visualizers , all of which can appear either in group info pages , sheets , or in their own pages. When they appear in their own pages, this is refered to as a \u201clarge view,\u201d and you can read about it in general here . This page covers the specifics for large views of multiplication tables. Reordering header row or header column You can choose the order of elements along the top row (or left column) of the multiplication table using your mouse. (Note that order of elements in the top row and left column determine the contents of the rest of the table. Group Explorer fills it out using the group operation.) To move an element from one point to another in the top row, shift-click [tap-hold] on the element\u2019s cell in the table and drag [one-finger drag] it to the new position (left or right in the top row). To move an element in the left column, the procedure is the same, except vertical. Note that the top row and left column will stay synchronized, so no matter which one you reorder, both will change. You can also ask Group Explorer to organize the top row/left column of the table according to a particular subgroup and its cosets; see below . Magnification You can move the multiplication table around by clicking it and dragging [two-finger drag]; you can zoom in and out with your mouse wheel [pinch open/close]. The center of zooming is always the center of the view, so if you wish to zoom around a different center, first click and drag to move that point to the center of the view, then you can zoom in and out centered on that point. [On a touch device just touch the screen with two fingers and simultaneously drag and pinch to translate and magnify the table with one gesture.] To restore the default magnification level (which re-centers the table and fits it into the view), right-click anywhere in the table [control click on Mac, two-finger tap on touch device]. The Table tab The controls panel for multiplication table large views has two tabs at the top: Subsets and Table. The first of these allows you to highlight subsets of the group in the table; see below for information on that tab . The second of these allows you to change the structure or appearance of the table in other ways. This section describes those controls. Organization by subgroup By default, the \u201cOrganize by subgroup:\u201d drop-down list at the top of the Table tab has \u201cnone\u201d selected. However, if you wish to organize the top row (and left column) of the multiplication table so that a particular subgroup is at the left (top) and its cosets follow it one after the other, you can choose that subgroup from this drop-down list. You can also choose the exact order of the elements in the top row or left column of the table manually; see above . Separation of cosets If you have made a selection on the \u201cOrganize by subgroup:\u201d drop-down list ( see above ), then Group Explorer also enables you to put some vertical and horizontal space between the cosets in the multiplication table, to help the viewer visually separate them. The slider under the \u201cSeparate cosets by:\u201d header determines how much space (the leftmost extreme is zero, no space, the default). This is especially useful when the subgroup in question is normal, because it helps visualize the quotient group. As an example, consider this multiplication table illustrating the quotient of D_4 by \\mathbb{Z}_2 . CITE(VGT-7.3 MM-3.5 DE-8.2) Colorization scheme There are three colorization schemes for multiplication tables: Spectrum/rainbow Grayscale None The first is the default, and makes multiplication tables use all the hues in the color spectrum, as in the first illustration on this page. Grayscale is appropriate if you intend to print on a black-and-white printer; the colors of gray contrast better than the rainbow hues, which all have the same saturation and intensity. Choosing None makes the multiplication table just black text on white background. Note that the colorization scheme you choose is overridden by any highlighting you do on the Subsets tab, documented on a separate page, as indicated below. Element recoloring on reorganization When you change the rows and columns of the multiplication table, either by dragging one of the rows/columns to a new location or by organizing the table by a different subgroup, the colors of the cells change, too. Group Explorer does this in a couple of different ways: it can keep the the top row (and left-most column) colors as they are, updating only the labels to reflect the reorganization; or it can keep the color currently associated with each label, changing the coloring of the top row as the labels are rearranged. (In either case this determines the contents and coloring of the rest of the table, as described above .) The first approach, keeping the top row colors intact, generally makes it easier to spot large patterns in the multiplication table through their similar hue. For example, in the following image of the \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_4 multiplication table organized by the H_2 subgroup, it is easy to recognize the orange and yellow colors of the upper left-hand corner subgroup in blocks on the bottom and right, indicating that H_2 is a normal subgroup. On the other hand, keeping the element colors unchanged makes it easier to follow the action of a particular element as the table is reorganized. Try them both!

If you are unsure what sheets are, read the description here . A blank sheet window looks something like the following picture. Let us consider all the things one can do with a sheet, grouping them categorically. The sheet itself A blank sheet is shown as a white region, the left side of the window pictured above. We\u2019ll call this \u201c display window \u201d in what follows. In this region you can display \u201csheet items,\u201d rectangular \u201cnodes\u201d connected by \u201clinks\u201d. Here is an image of a window containing a sheet with three items: two nodes, a multiplication table and box of text with a gray background, and a connecting line linking them together. The right side of the window, the \u201c control window ,\u201d displays some of the operations you can perform on the sheet. These include creating new items to add to the display, and loading and storing sheets for later use. Other operations are available through the context menus of the displayed sheet items, as discussed below . (If the control window isn\u2019t visible you can expose it by clicking the \u201c \u2329 \u201d icon in the upper right-hand menu. If it\u2019s visible and you\u2019d like to devote the entire browser viewport to the display window you can hide the sheet controls by clicking the \u201c \u232a \u201d icon.) If you wish to experiment with a sheet without creating one, there are links in each group\u2019s Group Info page that will create sheets for you (e.g. \u201cShow me all the views connected together in a sheet\u201d link in the Views section). Dialog boxes and menus Dialog boxes occur at several points in working with sheets for various reasons. You can move them around the screen by dragging them with your mouse [or finger] to a new position. Menu positions are fixed. Menus may be dismissed without taking any action by clicking somewhere on the page outside the menu. Diaglog boxes require an explicit action, however, like pressing a \u201cCancel\u201d button. Dialog inputs Many of the inputs accepted by Sheet dialogs will be displayed as HTML, not simply as text. This will be pointed out in the following discussion. Group theory nomenclature is filled with subscripts and special characters, and HTML enables these to be rendered as it is generally seen. Here are a few key points: you can use any Unicode character your browser recognizes, like \u201c \\mathbb{Z} \u201d or \u201c\u22ca\u201d you can used HTML entities like \u201c&#x2124;\u201d or \u201c&Zopf;\u201d (equivalent to \u201c \\mathbb{Z} \u201d) you can use simple inline HTML formatting like \u201c<i>\u2026</i>\u201d (italicize) and \u201c<sub>\u2026</sub>\u201d (subscript), so \u201c<i>H</i><sub>2</sub>\u201d displays as \u201c H 2 \u201c break lines with \u201c<br>\u201d, not \\n be careful of ambiguous uses of \u201c<\u201d and \u201c&\u201d; they must be written as \u201c&lt;\u201d and \u201c&amp;\u201d, respectively Some dialogs use both a slider and a textarea to set a configuration value: these values are synchronized automatically. Thus you can move the slider back and forth to get a qualitative idea of the parameter\u2019s effect on the display, and you can type in an exact value when you are trying to match another element. Control window Add element Click the \u201cRectangle\u201d button to add a solid gray rectangle to the sheet; click the \u201cText box\u201d button to add a small text box to the sheet containing the words \u201cEnter text.\u201d You can move and resize these items after they have been placed, including moving them forward or backwards in the sheet , as described below. Rectangles are useful for visually grouping items on the sheet by placing the rectangle behind them. Text boxes can be useful for labeling items on the sheet with a caption or an explanation. Both items serve only a visual purpose. As with all nodes on a sheet, select \u201cEdit\u201d from the item\u2019s context menu to edit its properties . Add visualizer Clicking one of the \u201cCayley diagram\u201d, \u201cMultiplication table\u201d, or \u201cCycle graph\u201d buttons will add a copy of the corresponding visualizer to the sheet in the upper left-hand corner. Choose the group you\u2019d like to visualize from the drop-down list below the buttons, which offers you a choice of any of the groups in the Group Explorer library (ordered by their number of elements). You can move and resize the visualizer much as you do with other nodes. See the discussion on visualizer editing for further information about configuring the visualizer. Stored sheets Group Explorer can store the sheets you develop and make them available for viewing at a later time, and it can import and export sheets as strings so you can share them or store them elsewhere. The stored sheets will persist even after you have left the Group Explorer website, or indeed even after you have turned your computer off. (They use your browser\u2019s \u201cIndexedDB\u201d storage.) The stored sheets are given names when they\u2019re saved, which are displayed like a list of files under the \u201cStored sheets\u201d heading. Much like a file browser, when you left-click [tap] one of sheet names you expose a menu of options, the \u201cstored sheet menu\u201d, as shown in the following picture. (If you click in an area that doesn\u2019t have a sheet name you just get the lower part of the menu. This will be the case, of course, if you\u2019ve just started using Group Explorer and haven\u2019t created any sheets yet.) We\u2019ll discuss the options individually in the following sections. Create, read, update, delete \u2013 oh CRUD Create: Save current sheet To create a new stored sheet and store the currently displayed sheet under that new sheet name, select \u201cSave current sheet\u201d from the stored sheet menu. A small dialog box will appear prompting you to enter a name. As explained above , this name will be displayed in the list as HTML. Type a name into the window and click \u201cOK\u201d to accept the name you\u2019ve provided, or \u201cCancel\u201d to terminate the operation. In either case, the contents of the display window are not affected. Read: Load to current sheet To load a stored sheet into the display window, select \u201cLoad to current sheet\u201d from the stored sheet menu. Any work you had in the display window will be immediately overwritten by loading the stored sheet. Update: Update from current sheet To update a sheet you\u2019ve already saved with the currently displayed sheet, select \u201cUpdate from current sheet\u201d from the stored sheet menu. The contents of the display window will immediately overwrite the previously stored sheet of that name, leaving the display window unchanged. Delete To delete a sheet you\u2019ve saved, select \u201cDelete\u201d from the stored sheet menu. Export and import JSON Group Explorer can export and import stored sheets as JSON strings, so you can share them or move them between computers. Export current sheet as JSON To export the currently displayed sheet, select \u201cExport current sheet as JSON\u201d from the stored sheet menu. A dialog box will appear with a (potentially very long) text string in its window. You can copy it from the window with your system\u2019s cut-and-paste operation. Changing the text will not affect the displayed sheet. Import JSON to current sheet To display a JSON string, select \u201cImport JSON to current sheet\u201d from the stored sheet menu. A dialog box will appear into which you can paste a (potentially very long) JSON string, such as one generated by a preceeding Export request. The imported information will immediately overwrite the contents of the display window. Refresh list This option will reload the names of the locally stored sheets from IndexedDB and display the results in the \u201cStored sheets\u201d list. This may be useful in the case that two Sheet tabs are open and a sheet stored in one tab is not reflected in the other, for example. Display control Redraw This button will redraw the current sheet with its original scale and center, clearing the effects of zooming and panning but retaining the current element configurations. It is useful after resizing the window, or after zooming in on a particular feature of a complex sheet. Clear This button will remove all objects from the sheet and recover its original scale and center. Display window Zoom and pan sheet view Resizing the window containing the sheet does not resize the sheet. If you would like to zoom in on a particular detail of a complex sheet you can do so with the mouse wheel or an equivalent scrolling gesture (like a two-fingered drag on a touchpad). [On a touch platform use a two-finger pinch/spread.] You can also pan around by right-clicking and dragging the screen. [On touch platforms use a two-finger drag, like zooming only keeping your fingers the same distance apart.] Moving a node Moving a node uses a drag-and-drop pattern familiar from other situations: left-click on the item and drag [one-touch drag] it to its new position. As you move the mouse around the sheet you will notice that the cursor changes when over a node, indicating that the move operation is enabled. Context menu Each node has a context menu, which can be raised by right-clicking [tapping] the element. An example of such a menu is shown in the picture below. These functions operate on the selected element. The context menu can be dismissed without making any changes by clicking on the screen away from it. Connecting lines and morphisms do not have a context menu: right-clicking on them brings up the element editor directly. Resize To resize a node, first select it by picking \u201cResize\u201d from the context menu, or by left-clicking [touch-holding] the node. Once selected, a light blue outline will appear around the node, and until it is deselected subsequent operations will affect only that node. You resize the selected node by dragging [one-finger] an edge. This is like resizing a window, except that you don\u2019t have to find the exact edge of the element to drag it: you can start the drag in the screen outside the element, as suggested in the picture below. Just as when resizing a window, the cursor will change when it\u2019s moved around the screen, reflecting the available operation. If you start the drag inside the selected element, it will just reposition the element without changing its size. You can also use the wheel (or a scrolling gesture) [pinch/spread on a touch platform] to expand/contract the element in all directions equally. Resizing or repositioning the element will not deselect it and may be done repeatedly. To deselect the element simply click [tap] elsewhere in the sheet and the blue outline will disappear. Edit Each of the sheet items can be further configured with an editor. Node editors are brought up by selecting the \u201cEdit\u201d option from their context menu; right-clicking [tapping] links brings up their element editors directly. Selecting \u201cEdit\u201d for a visualizer node opens a new tab in the browser with a large view of the visualizer, as explained below . Other elements present a modal dialog box in the Sheet tab. As with other Group Explorer dialog boxes, they may be dragged to a new location. Changes made in the dialog boxes are reflected immediately in the displayed sheet. The dialog is not dismissed until the changes are accepted with \u201cOK\u201d or reverted by clicking \u201cCancel.\u201d Rectangle and text box editor Rectangles and text boxes are very similar: internally, a rectangle is just a text box without text, and they use the same dialog box for editing. The picture below shows the text box editor. By default, text in a text box will be displayed as HTML (see above ), but you can override this by checking the \u201cDisplay as plain text\u201d box. The font color, size, text alignment, and background color may also be configured. The background opacity allows you to adjust the transparency of the node, ranging from completely transparent (opacity = 0, slider all the way to the left) to solid (opacity = 1). Connection editor Connecting lines may be configured by right-clicking [tapping] them: the sensitive area extends the length of the line and is at least a tenth of an inch wide. As the following picture shows, you can configure the connecting line\u2019s color, width, and whether or not it is drawn with an arrowhead. In addition to the options of accepting or reverting the changes in the editor, there is a button to delete the link entirely. Morphism editor Editing a morphism is somewhat more involved than editing the other Sheet items, so there is a separate help page on editing homomorphisms . Visualizer editing When you select \u201cEdit\u201d for a visualizer node, rather than presenting you with a small dialog (as with, say, rectangles or text boxes), Group Explorer opens a new tab in your browser with a large view of the visualizer. Changes you make in that large view (such as highlighting elements or changing the viewpoint on a three-dimensional diagram) will be reflected immediately in the sheet. You can close that visualizer tab at any time; changes you make there are continuously synced to the sheet. Group info Selecting the \u201cGroup info\u201d option from a visualizer\u2019s context menu will bring up the visualizer group\u2019s Group Info page . Copy Click this button to copy the selected item on the sheet. Another instance of the same item will immediately appear directly on top of the first instance. You can then move it to the location you desire. Creating links Create connection To connect one rectangular item in a sheet to another with a straight line, select \u201cCreate Connection\u201d from the first item\u2019s context menu. A dialog box will appear, prompting you to select a valid target for the connection, one that does not already share another connection or map with the first. Clicking a valid target will create a new connection, and brings up the connection editor. (The connection editor is preloaded with the configuration from its last use, so if you want to create several identical connections just configure the first one and click \u201cOk\u201d when asked to edit its successors.) The connection can always be deleted with connection editor\u2019s \u201cDelete\u201d button. Connections are useful for labelling items in a complex sheet or showing an intricate network of connections, as in a lattice of subgroups . Create map Connecting one visualizer in a sheet to another with a homomorphism is very similar to creating a connection . Select \u201cCreate Map\u201d from the first visualizer\u2019s context menu, then select a target visualizer. The target must not already share a connection or map with the first. Selecting the target creates the a new map and brings up the morphism editor. For more details, visit the help page on editing homomorphisms . Move forward, backward To move an item forward or backwards on the sheet (i.e. farther into the background, or closer to the foreground), open the element context menu and choose \u201cMove forward,\u201d \u201cMove backward\u201d, \u201cMove to Front,\u201d or \u201cMove to Back\u201d. Unlike selecting other options from the context menu, selecting one of these options does not dismiss the menu, so it can be performed repeatedly. Only nodes can be positioned in this way: the position of a link between nodes is determined by the positions of the nodes it connects. All connecting lines lie at the same level below (farther away than) the lowest of any connected node, so they don\u2019t obscure the nodes they connect in a busy sheet like a subgroup lattice . (Connecting lines can be positioned over an unconnected node, however.) By contrast, Morphism lines are positioned just on top of the nodes they connect, so you can see the elements they map. Delete This removes the selected item from the sheet. Note that if you delete an item that is connected to another item via a connecting line or morphism, the connection(s) will also be deleted.","title":"Sheet Options"},{"location":"rf-um-sheetwindow/#the-sheet-itself","text":"A blank sheet is shown as a white region, the left side of the window pictured above.

Group Explorer computes all subgroups of each group when loading it; the user cannot add or remove any entries from this section. The next portion of the window lists user-defined subsets, which is empty by default. You can add and delete subsets relevant to your study of the group; see below . The last portion of the window lists partitions of the group (e.g. conjugacy classes, cosets of a particular subgroup, etc.) and is particularly useful for creating informative highlightings of the visualizer. Partitions can be added to this section via various computations; see below . The subsets panel allows computations and highlighting with respect to both subsets and subgroups of whatever group is being visualized. It has many features, covered one at a time below. For any subset listed in the pane, you can find out its list of elements by double-clicking [touch and holding] the subset you\u2019re interested in. Right-clicking [tapping] on the subsets pane brings up a menu from which you can take several important actions, some of which are visible in the following screenshot. You can pin a submenu to keep it from disappearing by clicking [tapping] on its parent menu item (the line in the parent menu with a right-pointing triangle, like \u201cCompute \u25ba\u201d in the following screenshot); you can clear it by clicking [tapping] on the line again. Creating and deleting user-defined subgroups are both possible using this menu, as well as several types of computation and highlighing. Here follows the documentation for each option on this menu. Topmost items on the popup menu Edit list of elements in S_i This menu item appears only if you selected a user-defined subset. If you choose it, a window like the one pictured here opens. The left pane shows the elements in your subset and the right pane shows the other elements of the group. To add elements to your subset, drag them in from right to left. Dragging from the left pane to the right pane takes elements out of your subset. OK approves your changes and Cancel discards them. Delete S_i This menu item appears only if you selected a user-defined subset. Choosing it deletes the user-defined subset you selected. Delete CC_i , OC_i , gH_i , etc. This menu item appears only if you selected a partition (i.e. on one of its sets). Partitions can be conjugacy classes CC_i , order classes OC_i , left cosets gH_i , or right cosets H_ig . Choosing this option deletes the entire partition you selected (e.g. all conjugacy classes, all order classes, or all left/right cosets of the subgroup, etc.). Create S_i This menu item creates a new subset under the \u201cUser-defined subsets\u201d heading. The subset will be empty, and you can add elements to it as described above . The Compute > submenu Compute > all conjugacy classes CC_i This submenu item appears only if the conjugacy class partition does not already exist. It adds the set of conjugacy classes as a new partition under the \u201cPartitions\u201d heading. Compute > all order classes OC_i This submenu item appears only if the order class partition does not already exist. It adds the set of order classes as a new partition under the \u201cPartitions\u201d heading. Compute > normalizer of H_i , \\text{Norm}(H_i) This submenu item appears when you select the subgroup H_i . It adds the normalizer of the given subgroup to the list of user-defined subsets.

Compute > right cosets H_ig This submenu item appears when you select the subgroup H_i , but only if the partition by right cosets of that subgroup does not already exist. It adds the set of right cosets as a new partition under the \u201cPartitions\u201d heading. Compute > an intersection > subsubmenu This submenu appears when you select the subset X , and it contains items allowing you to perform an intersection of X with any other subset listed in the whole pane. Choosing one of the items on this submenu computes the intersection described in that item, e.g. \u201cthe intersection of H_2 with S_5 .\u201d Intersection here means simply what it does in set theory\u2013the elements in common between the two sets. Note that whenever you add a new subset, Group Explorer always checks whether it exists under another name, and gives you the option to cancel your addition if so.

Choosing one of the items on this submenu computes the elementwise product described in that item, e.g. \u201cthe elementwise product of H_2 with S_5 .\u201d Note that whenever you add a new subset, Group Explorer always checks whether it exists under another name, and gives you the option to cancel your addition if so. Highlight subset by > submenu This submenu appears only if you select a subset (as opposed to a heading). Its items depend on the visualizer as follows. For Cayley diagrams, highlighting options are Node color, Ring around node, and Square around node. For multiplication tables, highlighting options are Background, Border, and Corner. For cycle graphs, highlighting options are Background, Border, and Top. Choosing one causes the subset you selected to be highlighted in the visualizer (both its large and small incarnations) with the method you selected. For instance, here is a multiplication table with an order-4 subgroup highlighted according to corners. Note that this undoes any other highlighting of the type in question (e.g. former \u201cNode color\u201d highlighting will evaporate when new \u201cNode color\u201d highlighting is chosen). Note further that in multiplication tables, highlighting items by background highlighting removes the default coloration scheme (e.g. rainbow, grayscale).

First, we\u2019ll talk about a basic tip for how to get the most out of Group Explorer. Then I\u2019ll give you a taste of some of the value of visualization in group theory. Group info, all the way The first time you see a group info window , the amount of information it presents may be a bit overwhelming. But take care not to miss the section entitled \u201cComputed properties.\u201d For example, click here to visit the group info page for the group \\mathbb{Z}_6 and scroll down to the \u201cComputed properties\u201d section. That section contains much more information that it might at first seem to, and I recommend taking some time to investigate it. Follow the \u201ctell me more\u201d links and you\u2019ll find that Group Explorer will often tell you much more. Class equations For instance, click the \u201ctell me more\u201d link to the right of the class equation in the group info page you opened. You will find all of the following. A link to the definition of \u201cclass equation.\u201d An explanation of why your group has the class equation it does. Three links to different ways to visualize the class equation. As is an example, the class equation for D_5 shown using cycle graphs creates an image like the one shown below. A very important difference is that when you ask Group Explorer to automatically generate the illustration, then the result is interactive. You can manipulate each component of the illustration, unlike the static image above. CITE(VGT-7.5 MM-3.7 TJ-14.2) Subgroups But far more deep information is available under the \u201ctell me more\u201d link next to the number of subgroups. Under that link you will find all of the following information. A link that will show you the lattice of subgroups for your group, in any of several formats. The name, index, and order of each subgroup of your group, in addition to an illustration of it as a group on its own, and an answer as to whether it is normal. Links to see each of the illustrations as a large visualizer which you can edit. For normal subgroups, links to diagrams witnessing the normality of the subgroup, using a short exact sequence of homomorphisms, which will contain the quotient group. Whether your group is simple, and why. Links to definitions of every term used on this list, as well as several others that show up. In summary, do not ignore the computed properties of a group in its info page! It is an excellent place to start learning about a group and to start learning some group theory terminology in a fairly concrete context, with definitions readily available. CITE(VGT-6 MM-3.1 DE-4.1 TJ-3.3) \u201cGetting\u201d the Fundamental Theorem Now let\u2019s get a taste of some of the power group theory visualization has for building intuition. The Fundamental Theorem of Abelian groups states that every abelian group is simply a product of cyclic groups. From this, group theorists conclude that abelian groups are less interesting to study than nonabelian groups, because this theorem effectively completely classifies them. We understand them thoroughly, through this theorem. But the first-time you experience group theory, such a theorem may hardly seem to give complete understanding of abelian groups. It may actually seem rather opaque. Let\u2019s see how Group Explorer can show us what this theorem means. Cyclic groups The theorem says that abelian groups are products of cyclic groups. So then we ask, what are cyclic groups? They are groups that are generated by one element running in a cycle, hence the name. Their Cayley diagrams and cycle graphs all look like circles, as shown below. From left to right, we have the Cayley diagrams of \\mathbb{Z}_3 and \\mathbb{Z}_6 followed by the cycle graphs of \\mathbb{Z}_8 and \\mathbb{Z}_{15} . If we ask Group Explorer to use a linear axis for displaying a cyclic group, it stretches it out into a line, with one loop connecting the end of the line to the beginning, like this. Remember this image, because it is important below. Abelian groups Let\u2019s take a look at the Cayley diagrams of some abelian groups. You can tell which ones are abelian by looking at the \u201cAbelian\u201d computed property in their group info page. Better still, in the main window you can show the \u201cAbelian\u201d column and see yes/no for each group. From left to right, we have the Cayley diagrams of V_4 , \\mathbb{Z}_3\\times\\mathbb{Z}_3 , \\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2 , and \\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_4\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2 . What do you see when you look at these diagrams? Notice that all of these diagrams are assembled from pieces which are like the image of a linear cyclic group shown earlier. That is, many little linear cyclic groups, at right angles to one another, combine to form each of these diagrams. From this we can conclude two useful things. We begin to understand what a product is. If abelian groups are just products of cyclic groups, then this product operation must mean simply something like \u201cattaching a bunch of copies at right angles.\u201d This is essentially true, and has an important contrast to other kinds of group product operations, such as the semidirect product. (There are a few semidirect products in Group Explorer\u2019s library. If you view them, you will notice their Cayley diagrams are quite tangled\u2013not plain and simple right angles at all!) We begin to understand the meaning and significance of the theorem. Now when a group theorist tells you that the Fundamental Theorem of Abelian groups completely explains abelian groups, you can have a better understanding of what he\u2019s saying. The theorem stated Every abelian group is a product of cyclic groups. Now that we\u2019ve looked at a few diagrams of abelian groups, we can perhaps rephrase the theorem to describe what we\u2019ve seen. Every abelian group is composed entirely of short lines attached at right angles. In our rephrasing the \u201cshort lines\u201d are linear representations of cyclic groups, and the \u201cattached at right angles\u201d corresponds to the notion of a product. This does make abelian groups sound both straightforward and readily understandable, especially when we contrast them with nonabelian groups. Let\u2019s take a look at a few Cayley diagrams for nonabelian groups. From left to right, below, we have the Cayley diagrams for Q_4 , \\mathbb{Z}_3\\rtimes\\mathbb{Z}_4 , a nonabelian group of order 21, and S_4 . See how much more tangled (and therefore complex) they are! By contrast, surely the nonabelian groups are the ones that require more study.

Here we will concentrate on the basic manipulations you might want to perform on a group\u2019s multiplication table as you investigate that group. For more introductory information on multiplication tables, refer to the definition of a multiplication table or a quick introduction to multiplication tables . For more complete information on the multiplication table interface, refer to the relevant section of the user manual . Zooming Use your mouse scroll wheel or a pinch gesture to zoom in and out. If a group is very large, you may want to view its multiplication table shrunk to the point where you can see it comfortably on screen. Conversely, if a group is very small, you may want to blow up the multiplication table. Organizing The order of elements across the top and down the left side of a multiplication table is chosen by Group Explorer to be somewhat natural. But if you would prefer a different order, hold the Shift key while you click and drag on a (non-identity) element in either the top row or left column and drop it where you want it. The table will change when you drop it. You can also reorganize the table according to subgroups by using the drop-down list on the Table tab of the controls. For full documentation on the Table tab, refer to the relevant section of the user manual . Highlighting You can highlight the multiplication table according to various properties of the group elements. This can be useful for studying different properties of the group.

This page provides a quick introduction to sheets. To go directly to the details of the sheet interface and how to use it, visit this page of the User Manual . Let\u2019s begin with \u201cMaking your own sheets,\u201d but you can jump down to \u201c Getting Group Explorer to make sheets for you, \u201d below, where the fancier stuff shows up. Making your own sheets Let\u2019s use a sheet to compare two groups of the same order, \\mathbb{Z}_6 and S_3 . From the Group Explorer main page, click the Sheet icon on the top right hand side of the page. This creates a new sheet. In the control window on the right hand side of the sheet, select \\mathbb{Z}_6 from the \u201cGroup\u201d drop-down list and click the \u201cCycle graph\u201d button above it. You should see a small cycle graph for \\mathbb{Z}_6 appear in the upper left-hand corner of the left side of the sheet. I resized mine slightly and the result was as follows. (To move a visualizer just drag it with the mouse or your finger; to resize it right-click [tap] it and select \u2018Resize\u2019 from the resulting context menu. A light blue outline will appear around the visualizer. Then drag starting outside the element in the direction you\u2019d like it to grow. A short click [tap] will dismiss the blue outline. See here for more details.) But that\u2019s just one visualizer; we want to have at least two. So let\u2019s repeat the same steps for inserting a cycle graph for S_3 as well, but move it a little to the right of the first one, as shown below. Now let\u2019s start comparing these groups. In group theory, the means of examining relationships between groups is via homomorphisms . So let\u2019s create one in this sheet, as follows: Right-click [tap] the left cycle graph element to open its context menu Select the \u201cCreate Map\u201d option from menu Click [tap] the other cycle graph, the homomorphism target. You should see a new function f appear, connecting the two graphs. So far this isn\u2019t very informative, but if we right-click [tap] the morphism label box to open its context menu and select \u201cEdit\u201d, we can do all sorts of interesting things. For instance, you can decide which elements from \\mathbb{Z}_6 should correspond to which elements from S_3 . Furthermore, Group Explorer will not let you mess this up (you cannot define a non-homomorphism.) The morphism editing dialog is shown below. The homomorphism defaults to the zero map (all elements map to the identity, in this case e ) but you can change it, of course. I will map a to r and then check the \u201cDraw multiple arrows\u201d box above. The result is the following illustration of one way to map \\mathbb{Z}_6 to S_3 . The arrows require some attention to follow carefully, but you can see how the six-element circle marches around the little three-element circle twice. I\u2019ve taken the liberty of highlighting \\mathbb{Z}_6 red and its image in S_3 red also. (To do so, open the element context menu for the visualizer you\u2019d like to highligh and select \u201cEdit\u201d. Then play with its subsets as documented here .)
