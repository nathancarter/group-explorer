<p>This page documents the interface for the large view of a <a href="rf-groupterms.html#cyclegraph">cycle graph</a>. A cycle graph is one of Group Explorer's four <a href="rf-geterms.html#visualizers">visualizers</a>, all of which can appear either in <a href="rf-um-helpwindow.html">help windows</a>, <a href="rf-geterms.html#sheet">sheets</a>, or in their own windows. When they appear in their own windows, this is refered to as a &quot;large view,&quot; and you can read about it in general <a href="rf-um-largewindow.html">here</a>. This page concentrates specifically on the differences between a large view for cycle graphs, as compared to the other visualizers. </p>

<h2>Interface specifics</h2>
<h3>Magnification</h3>
<p>On the edit menu and on the toolbar for large windows viewing cycle graphs, you will find controls for Zoom in<img src="iconimg/zoomin.png" width="22" height="22"> and Zoom out<img src="iconimg/zoomout.png" width="22" height="22">. These controls simply change the magnification level at which you are viewing the cycle graph. For a very small cycle graph, you may want a large image, and zooming in is useful. For a very large cycle graph (and a not-so-large screen) you may find that zooming out is helpful. </p>
<!--<h3>Dragging an image copy</h3>
<p>If you click on the cycle graph and hold your mouse button down while dragging the mouse across the screen, you will drag a copy of the cycle graph image (as a pixmap). This can be useful for dropping it as an image into other applications, such as word processing or presentation programs. </p>-->
